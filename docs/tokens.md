### Design tokens are the atoms of the system as [Salesforce](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/) describes them. In the LUX Design System they are used instead of hard coded values to ensure a better consistency across any platform.

The documentation you see below is auto generated by LUX. To see how itâ€™s formatted, see [/docs/components/tokens/](https://github.com/pulibrary/lux/tree/master/docs/components/tokens).
